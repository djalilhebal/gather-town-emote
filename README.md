# Gather Town: Emote Wheel

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/icon128.png" />
  <p>Emote wheel for Gather.Town.</p>
</div>

**Usage:**
- Press <kbd>Control</kbd> and mouse left-click to show the emote wheel.

**Disclaimer**:
The implementation is somewhat hacky, especially regarding Chrome Extension-related aspects, like how different parts (the action popup, content scripts, or whatever) interact with each other. \
Still, it's good enough for a weekend project.


## Features / Screenshots

Tested with:
- Google Chrome 134.
- Gather Town on 2025-03-28 (version unknown, HTTP/WS API V2?)


### Emote wheel

Notice that at the end of the video, the emote "Omega" is cleared after about 3 seconds, mimicking Gather's default behavior.

Also, notice that there is no emote wheel here. It only appears if the user is actually in-game, as opposed to the welcome screen, for example.

### Emote editor

Notice that each input indicates the direction/position of the emote in the wheel.
Not the best UI/UX, but it's better than nothing.

**Some emotes/emoji/symbols to try:**
- ðŸŽ¡
- ðŸ«¡
- Î©
- â¬¢

## Installation

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory.
5. The extension should now be installed and active.


## Background

The way it works is _not unlike_ Super Scoreboard (https://github.com/djalilhebal/super-scoreboard)--an overlay "superimposed" over another game.

I considered using [`pointer-events: none`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) to achieve a similar effect, but `display: none` was enough.

Initially, I planned to create the emote wheel using Java with the libGDX libraries [PieMenu](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu) and [Vis UI](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-ui). However, I went with a simpler implementation: vanilla JavaScript. \
V0 and Claude assisting in the development of the circular menu.

After inspecting/debugging Gather, I found a convenient global object `game` with an even more convenient method `setEmote`. \
The gotcha was that `setEmote` does not unset it automatically after some delay, so I had to re-implement that logic.


### Inspiration

- League's emote wheel
